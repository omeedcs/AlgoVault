# Basic Interview Preparation

A subset of data structures, algorithms, and problem solutions to prepare for technical interviews. 

## Repository Contents

This repository contains implementations of common algorithms and solutions to coding problems frequently asked in technical interviews:

- **Data Structures**: BST, Trie, LRU Cache, Heap, Hash Map, Circular Buffer
- **Graph Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, Floyd's Cycle Detection
- **Search Algorithms**: Binary Search (including variants)
- **Dynamic Programming**: Examples like Fibonacci
- **Backtracking**: Permutations, Subsets, Combination Sum
- **Tree Traversals**: Level Order, Right Side View, Diameter
- **Matrix/Grid Problems**: 2D searches, island deletion

## Language

All implementations are in Python, focused on readability and efficient solutions.

## How to Use

Each file contains a standalone implementation or problem solution that can be run independently. Use these examples to:

1. Study algorithm implementations
2. Practice common interview patterns
3. Test your understanding by tracing through the code
4. Prepare for Google and other tech interviews

Feel free to modify, extend, or use these implementations for your personal interview preparation.
